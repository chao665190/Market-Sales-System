# Market-Sales-System

Let us assume that there is a wholesale club 🛒. It sells products to the U.S. market 🇺🇸 and the Chinese market 🇨🇳.

One day the market manager calls 📞 you and would like you to help them develop one software application 📱 for their three latest holiday boxes 🎁 🎁 🎁:
1. 🎉The chocolate box which values $70 and contains chocolate1, chocolate2, chocolate3.
2. 🎉The nut box which values $100 and contains nut1, nut2, nut3.
3. 🎉The seafood box which values $250 and contains seafood1, seafood2, seafood3.

The manager also told you something about the market 🇨🇳🇺🇸:
The chocolate box and the nut box only sell in the U.S. market, and the seafood box only sells in the Chinese market.

The manager also told you something about the sales channel:
They have three sales channels:
🏠in-store, at regular price.
🖥online PC web, with 10% more than the regular price
📱online mobile web with a 10% discount based on the regular price.

The manager also told you something about the student discount:
👩‍🎓👨‍🎓Students can have a 10% discount through whatever channel.

The manager also told you something about the advertising:🪧
1. Different people will see different advertisements. More specificly, one student will see "Special discount applies! 🎉". General customers will see "Shopping, easy and fast!👌".
2. There is a cost to distributing advertisements which are evenly distributed to each order,
Orders in-store will cost the wholesale club $10.
Online PC web orders will cost the wholesale club $12.
Online mobile web orders will cost the wholesale club $11.

In conclusion, the manager said:
"The customer type decides what advertisement can be seen."
"The market and channel decide what box can be searched."
"The channel and customer type decide the price."

The application should have functions below:
1. let the customer know how much 💰 should they pay for their box.
2. let managers know sales revenues 💵 by market, channel, ads, and boxes(solution offers).
3. let managers know the profit of all orders.

Ok, in the end, the manager said:
"You can code me one sample of this application these day"
Let's imagine there are only three customers:

Chao, from US Market🇺🇸, who is a student👩‍🎓, uses an In-store channel for two chocolate boxes🍫.

Archil, from US Market🇺🇸, who is a student👨‍🎓, uses an Online PC web channel for three nut boxes🌰.

Joe, from Chinese Market🇨🇳, who is NOT a student👨‍🍳, uses an Online Mobile channel for one seafood box🦞.

This project is what I wrote for the sample of the application.

Enjoy!
